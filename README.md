## Package aims

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This package analyses laboratory irrigation experiments on soil columns.
It uses the viscous flow approach by Germann (2018).

## Installation

You can install ViscousFlow from GitHub with \`devoolts’ like so:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ChrisBogner/ViscousFlow")
```

## Example

The package contains two data sets, namely `tracer` and `drainage`. Both
originate from the publication by Bogner and Germann (2019) (there
called column C1, irrigation intensity 10 mm h\[x^{-1}\]).

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:
TODO

``` r
library(ViscousFlow)
## basic example code
```
